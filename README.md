# Woodpatch G-code Toolkit

A G-code parser, visualiser and machining-time estimator for CNC routers, written in
TypeScript. It aims to handle real-world CAM output without silent errors, estimate
cut time from calibrated machine parameters, and edit programs (translate, rotate,
mirror, scale, unit conversion, feed override) while leaving untouched lines
byte-for-byte identical.

> **Status: early development (Phase 0, scaffold).** There is nothing to use yet. The
> packages below are placeholders apart from `@woodpatch/gcode-core`'s skeleton.

## Acknowledgements

This project is a fork of **[webgcode](https://github.com/nraynaud/webgcode) by
Nicolas Raynaud**, and it starts from his work. From webgcode it inherits the
G-code parser and its grbl-derived arc maths, the trapezoidal speed planner behind
the time estimate, and the design of the 2D/3D path viewer with editor-line
highlighting. Those are being **rewritten** here in TypeScript, with a line model,
diagnostics and a modern three.js/CodeMirror stack. The original code is kept
unchanged under [`legacy/`](legacy/), with its full history. See
[`legacy/README.upstream.md`](legacy/README.upstream.md) for the upstream project's
own README.

webgcode is offered by its author under a choice of MIT **or** AGPL-3.0. This
toolkit is distributed under the **MIT** option. Upstream's own licence file is
preserved unmodified as [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt), this project's licence is in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE), and [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) has the full attribution.

**Fork point:** upstream `gh-pages` at `d315a359` ("add visucam link", 2025-09-18),
tagged here as `upstream-2025-09-18`. Upstream's `gh-pages` and `master` branches
are kept exactly as upstream left them.

## Development

Requires Node 22+ and pnpm 12 (the exact version is pinned in `package.json`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm lint        # ESLint + Prettier
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm licence:packages   # MIT notice present in every built package and minified bundle
reuse lint              # every file carries copyright + licence information
```

Contributions need a DCO sign-off; see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Licence

MIT; see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`NOTICE`](NOTICE). If you bundle these packages,
keep legal comments in your minifier output (for example esbuild
`legalComments: 'inline'` or `'eof'`). Each package's built entry carries the MIT
notice as a `/*! … */` banner, and MIT requires it to travel with copies of the
software, minified ones included.

# Architecture decision records

One entry per decision: context, the decision, and its consequences. Entries are
never deleted. A reversed decision gets a new entry that supersedes the old one, and
the old one is marked as superseded.

Status values: **Accepted** · **Pending** (proceeding on a stated default, isolated so
it can be reversed) · **Superseded by ADR-NNNN**.

---

## ADR-0001: Licence: elect the MIT arm of upstream's dual licence

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-22.

**Context.** Upstream webgcode is offered by Nicolas Raynaud under **MIT or AGPL-3.0**,
in a single licence file. Under a dual licence the recipient chooses. An earlier draft
of the programme plan assumed AGPL-3.0, with a separate MIT arrangement for internal
use. That split turned out to be unnecessary once the licence file was read directly.

**Decision.** Distribute this project under **MIT**.

- `LICENSE`: the MIT text verbatim, carrying both copyright lines (Nicolas Raynaud
  2016; this project 2026). The election is explained in `NOTICE`, never inside the
  permission notice.
- `LICENSE.txt`: upstream's own dual-licence file, **byte-identical and at its
  original path**. It arrived with the fork's history. A second copy (a planned
  `LICENSE.upstream`) was deliberately not added, because two files would give two
  answers to "which one is upstream's?". CI checks its SHA-256.
- `NOTICE`: upstream, author, fork point, the election, and the built-artefact rule
  (ADR-0009).

**Consequences.** There is no copyleft and no network-use source-offer obligation. A
visible "Based on webgcode by Nicolas Raynaud" credit is courtesy rather than a
requirement, and `@woodpatch/gcode-core` exports it as `ATTRIBUTION` so every surface
uses the same wording. The obligation that does remain is MIT's notice condition,
which ADR-0009 enforces mechanically. No CLA is needed (ADR-0008).

## ADR-0002: Copyright holder

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Decision.** New work is `Copyright (c) <year> Promotional Notions Pty Ltd trading as
Woodpatch House & Garden`, which is the legal entity followed by its trading name. It
appears in `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and each file's `SPDX-FileCopyrightText`. Upstream
files keep `Nicolas Raynaud`.

## ADR-0003: Stack

**Status:** Pending (proceeding on the default).

**Default.** pnpm workspace monorepo; TypeScript in strict mode; `core` has zero
runtime dependencies and runs in Node, browsers and workers; viewer on current
three.js; editor on CodeMirror 6; Svelte 5 components for host apps; a small Node HTTP
service for server-side estimates; Vitest; esbuild for package builds; Changesets for
releases.

**Isolation.** Host frameworks sit at the edge. `core`, `viewer` and `editor` are
framework-free, and only `svelte` depends on Svelte, so changing the host framework
replaces one thin package.

## ADR-0004: Repository name and home

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-22.

**Decision.** `chrisgrulau/woodpatch-gcode-toolkit`, a GitHub **fork** of
`nraynaud/webgcode`, so that the "forked from" relationship and the full upstream
history carry through. `main` is cut from upstream `gh-pages` HEAD (`d315a359`), tagged
`upstream-2025-09-18`. Upstream's `gh-pages` and `master` are left untouched.
`upstream` is kept as a git remote. History is never force-pushed.

## ADR-0005: Park upstream under `legacy/`; licensing scope for it

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Context.** Only about 1,000 lines of upstream (the parser, planner and viewer core)
matter to this project, and they are being rewritten rather than ported. The rest is
CAM, USB machine control and STM32 firmware. Upstream also vendors about 218 files of
third-party libraries in `webapp/libs/`, and about 70 of them carry no licence header.

**Decision.**

- The whole upstream tree moves under `legacy/` via `git mv` in one PR with no content
  edits, so `git log --follow` keeps working. `legacy/` keeps its internal layout, so
  the old simulator's relative paths and the Phase 1 harness still work.
- `legacy/` is **never built, linted, bundled, published or served**. It stays for
  one release as a reference and is then deleted. Git history and the
  `upstream-2025-09-18` tag preserve it regardless.
- **Licensing records** (`REUSE.toml`): upstream's own files are annotated
  `MIT OR AGPL-3.0-only`, © 2016 Nicolas Raynaud. The vendored libraries in
  `legacy/webapp/libs/**` are redistributed as received, each under its own licence.
  _Amended 2026-09-25:_ the Phase 0 placeholder `LicenseRef-legacy-vendored` is
  retired. A per-library audit ([`docs/legacy-libraries.md`](legacy-libraries.md): 38
  top-level entries grouped into 34 rows) records each library's real SPDX identifier:
  MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, BSL-1.0, ISC, OFL-1.1, and MIT-or-BSD-3-Clause for
  RequireJS.
  - **Four Ace modes were removed**: `mode-r`, `mode-rdoc`, `mode-rhtml` and `mode-tex`.
    They are RStudio's contributions to Ace, under **AGPL-3.0-only** with no
    permissive alternative. Nothing loads them; the only mode upstream sets is
    `javascript`. This is a deliberate, recorded deviation from "as received". The
    files remain in history and at the upstream tag.
  - Flot's resize plugin is dual MIT/GPL, and **MIT is elected**. That's recorded as an
    election in the table.
  - With those two handled, every file in the tree is under a permissive licence.
  - One file can't be pinned down: `yenc.js`, whose author declared only "BSD" and
    shipped no text (`LicenseRef-yenc-BSD-unspecified`).

  The audit table is the single source (`tools/data/legacy-libs.json`). A generator
  writes both `REUSE.toml` and the doc, and CI fails if either drifts from the table.
  **The same check reads every covered file's header** and fails on a GPL-family
  notice that the table doesn't account for. That is how the four Ace modes should
  have been caught the first time, and it's mutation-tested. Nothing may be copied from
  `libs/` into the toolkit's packages without first checking that library's entry.

- The one planned consumer is `tools/legacy-harness.cjs`. It loads
  `libs/jsparse.js` (Chris Double, BSD-style licence per its header) at test time
  only.

**Alternative rejected.** Deleting `libs/` apart from `jsparse.js` now. That would
make the licensing trivially clean, but it breaks the legacy simulator, which Phase 1
needs to benchmark upstream rendering.

## ADR-0006: CI on GitHub-hosted runners, with no third-party actions

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Context.** The repository's Actions policy permits only actions defined in the
owner's own repositories, pinned to full commit SHAs, so `actions/checkout` and
`actions/setup-node` are unavailable. The repository is public.

**Decision.**

- **GitHub-hosted runners only.** A self-hosted runner on a public repository would
  execute arbitrary fork-PR code on our own infrastructure.
- **No `uses:` steps.** Checkout is a few lines of `git`. Node and pnpm are downloaded
  by `.github/ci/setup-toolchain.sh` and verified against hashes **pinned in that
  file** (not against checksums fetched from the same server). Bumping a tool
  version means bumping its hash in the same commit.
- `permissions: contents: read`. Event values reach shell through `env`, never
  through `${{ }}` interpolation into script text.
- One tool is version-pinned but not hash-pinned: `reuse`, run via
  `pipx run 'reuse==6.2.0'`. That is accepted because its blast radius is its own
  job, which has `contents: read`, no secrets and no artefact output. Hash-pin it
  (`--require-hashes`) if that job ever gains write access or produces output
  anything else consumes.
- The jobs (`checks`, `reuse`, `provenance`) are the required status checks on `main`.
  Renaming a job means updating branch protection.

## ADR-0007: Dependency supply-chain safeguards

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Decision.**

- `minimumReleaseAge: 10080` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: no dependency version younger
  than 7 days is resolved. Most malicious npm releases are detected and pulled within
  that window.
- Dependency install scripts are blocked (pnpm's default). Each exception is listed
  in `allowBuilds` with the reason. The only one so far is `esbuild: false`: its
  script only swaps in a native binary for startup speed, and esbuild works without
  it.
- Exact tool versions: pnpm via `packageManager`, and reuse pinned in CI. The
  lockfile is always installed `--frozen-lockfile`.
- TypeScript is pinned to `~6.0` because `typescript-eslint` does not yet support
  TypeScript 7. Revisit when it does.

## ADR-0008: DCO sign-off instead of a CLA

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Context.** A CLA was planned under the AGPL assumption, so that contributions could
be relicensed for internal use. Under MIT (ADR-0001), inbound and outbound licences
are the same.

**Decision.** Every PR commit carries `Signed-off-by:` matching its author
([DCO](https://developercertificate.org)). `.github/ci/check-dco.sh` enforces it in
the `provenance` job.

## ADR-0009: MIT's notice travels with built artefacts, enforced in CI

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Context.** MIT's single condition is that its copyright and permission notice be
included in "all copies or substantial portions of the Software". For a browser
toolkit, the realistic way to break that is a bundler or minifier stripping the
header. The GitHub "forked from" badge is attribution, not a notice.

**Decision.**

- `scripts/build-package.mjs` prepends a `/*! … */` legal banner to every package's
  built entry. It is **generated from `LICENSE` itself**, so it cannot drift, and
  carries both copyright lines, the permission notice and the upstream credit.
- Every publishable package declares `"license": "MIT"` and ships `LICENSE` and
  `NOTICE`, copied from the root at build time.
- `scripts/check-package-licences.mjs` (CI, `checks` job) fails unless all of the
  following hold:
  - the manifest is right;
  - the copies are byte-identical to the root;
  - `npm pack` would include them;
  - the built entry starts with the banner;
  - the banner survives a **minified consumer bundle** under both of esbuild's
    legal-comment-preserving modes.
- The check requires the permission-notice text, not only the name "Nicolas
  Raynaud". The name also appears in `ATTRIBUTION`'s data, so a bare name grep would
  pass even with the notice stripped. A negative test confirmed this.

**Consequences for consumers.** Vite's production build drops legal comments by
default. Any app that bundles these packages must opt in (for example esbuild
`legalComments: 'inline'` or `'eof'`) and should grep its own build output the same
way.

## ADR-0010: The workspace root is not an ES-module package

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24.

**Context.** With `"type": "module"` in the root `package.json`, Node loads
upstream's CommonJS/AMD files under `legacy/` as ES modules. `require()` then returns
a frozen module namespace, and the legacy harness fails when jsparse tries to set
`memoize`.

**Decision.** The root `package.json` has no `"type"`. Root-level ESM files use
`.mjs`, and CommonJS tooling uses `.cjs`. Packages under `packages/` declare
`"type": "module"` themselves.

## ADR-0011: The programme plan is not kept in this repository

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-24; ratified by the operator, 2026-09-26.

**Context.** The original plan asked for a copy of itself in the repo as
`docs/PLAN.md`. That plan is an internal document: it describes internal
infrastructure, business systems and commercial processes. This repository is public.

**Decision.** The plan stays internal and is **not** kept here. This file (the ADR log)
is the public record of decisions and their reasons, and the README describes status
and layout. The same rule applies to everything else committed here: package
descriptions, comments and docs name no internal hosts, systems or customers, and
refer to consumers only as "consuming applications". Customer G-code never enters
this repository or its history.

## ADR-0012: Characterisation goldens: what they record, and how big they may be

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-25 (operator chose "option C").

**Context.** Phase 2 rewrites upstream's parser. To show that every behaviour change is
deliberate, upstream's own output (bugs included) is recorded first, as _goldens_. A full
path for the large upstream samples would be about 46 MB (aztec alone is 34 MB), and
git keeps every version forever.

**Decision.**

- `tools/golden-legacy.cjs` runs upstream's parser and simulator (via
  `tools/legacy-harness.cjs`) over `fixtures/synthetic/` and `fixtures/upstream/`, and
  writes `fixtures/golden/legacy/**.json`. Each golden records:
  - the outcome (ok, or the thrown error's class);
  - upstream's reported errors;
  - its console output;
  - the simulator's bounding box and time;
  - the path, as compact tuples.
- **Size policy (option C).** A path of at most 10,000 segments is stored in full.
  Above that, the golden stores the summary, the first and last 200 segments, and a
  SHA-256 of the full canonical path. Any change to any segment is detected, and
  `--full <file>` prints the whole path locally for diagnosis. Total size is about
  590 KB, against about 46 MB for full paths.
- Numbers are rounded to 6 decimals and `-0` is normalised. NaN and ±Infinity are
  stored as strings, because upstream really produces them (R2).
- The worker `$` (what the live simulator ran) is the primary record. For synthetic
  cases, the jQuery-faithful `$` is also run and recorded only where it differs. Today
  that is R1 with `SIN`, exactly the root cause the plan identified.
- **CI regenerates every golden and fails on any difference**, so goldens change only
  through the reviewed generator. `tools/legacy-reference.test.cjs` checks the goldens
  against independently published reference measurements (error counts, bounding
  boxes, times) for all four upstream samples.

**Consequences.** Where upstream was right, Phase 2 must match these goldens; where it
was wrong, it must differ, and each difference is listed. Deleting or regenerating a
golden to make a test pass defeats the purpose, so the generator is the only writer.

## ADR-0013: Commit identity

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-25.

**Decision.** Keep the current commit identity. Squash-merges on `main` are authored by
the automation bot's GitHub no-reply address, and the branch commits' `Signed-off-by:`
lines keep the contributing role's address. Past history is not rewritten.

## ADR-0014: Phase 2 performance target is parse + interpret

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26 (operator).

**Context.** The original target was "the 224k-line aztec sample parses in ≤ 2 s in
Node". Upstream already parses it in 1.4 s (ANALYSIS §9), so parse-only is barely a bar.

**Decision.** The target is **parse + interpret ≤ 2 s** for aztec_calendar.ngc on the
reference machine and pinned Node. After parcel 2a, the lossless tokenizer alone takes
about 0.84 s (872,824 tokens, 0 diagnostics), which leaves about 1.1 s for the
interpreter.

**Enforced in CI** (amended 2026-09-26, reviewer, toolkit #10). Absolute times on a CI
runner can't be compared with a target set on the reference machine, so CI checks a
**ratio**: core parse + interpret of aztec, divided by upstream's own parse of aztec, both
measured on the same runner in the same job (`node tools/bench-core.mjs --ci`). On the
reference machine the target is 2000 / 1379 ms = **1.45×**. After parcel 2c-1 the ratio is
about 1.3×, so the remaining budget is visible, and spending it fails the build.

_Measurement amended 2026-09-26 (toolkit 2c-2)._ The core's own time varies about ±10%
between measurements, because parsing aztec allocates about 2.6 million small objects and
the garbage collector's timing varies. Upstream's time is steady. So the gate:

- times each side in its own block, core first, with a forced collection before every
  run (`node --expose-gc`), keeping the minimum;
- retries a measurement that comes out over budget, up to 3 attempts, and fails only
  if all are over.

A real regression fails every attempt; noise rarely does. Every attempt is printed. The
lasting cure is fewer allocations: the path model (2d) avoids per-segment objects, and a
leaner token representation is the next lever if the budget stays tight.

_Ratcheted 2026-09-26 (reviewer, toolkit #11)._ The fast path never ran in 2c-2's first
cut: the G letter was missing from its table. The fix (203eab0) roughly halved the core's
time. The measurements:

| Where           | Before the fix | After       |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Locally (aztec) | about 1.6 s    | about 0.8 s |
| Locally (ratio) | —              | about 0.65× |
| CI (ratio)      | 1.38×          | 0.74–1.04×  |

The CI range is for near-identical code on different runners: upstream's own parse
alone ranged from 486 to 943 ms. So the ratio is less machine-independent than assumed
above.

The limit is now **1.2×**. That protects most of the gain and catches a slide back
towards the old 1.4×, without failing on runner variation. The cost is that on a
slow-ratio runner, a regression of up to about 15% can still pass.

A pass that needed a retry now prints a `::warning::` annotation, so creep shows on the
PR's checks and not only in a log nobody reads. The 2 s absolute target on the reference
machine is unchanged, and now has about 60% headroom.

## ADR-0015: Primary dialect is Masso G3, firmware v5.13

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26 (operator).

**Decision.** The `masso-g3` dialect profile is built from Masso's published G-code
reference for **firmware v5.13**, the version in use. Every code on that list is either
implemented or produces a diagnostic, and none is silently ignored. A `generic` profile
sits alongside it. Masso differs from the LinuxCNC-style model in ways the core must
handle per dialect, not globally:

- Fanuc-style `M98`/`M99` subprograms rather than O-word `sub`/`call`;
- canned cycles G73 and G81–G83 only;
- G68/G69 coordinate rotation, G38.x probing and G54.1 extended offsets;
- machine-specific M-codes.

## ADR-0016: Cutter compensation is drawn uncompensated, with a warning

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26 (operator).

**Decision.** In Phase 2, G41/G42 are recognised and tracked in the modal state, and
the path is drawn **uncompensated**. A warning on the G41/G42 line says so, and names
the D offset that was not applied. Real offset-path compensation goes on the roadmap.
CAM output rarely relies on controller compensation, and a clearly-labelled
uncompensated path is honest where a half-right offset would not be.

## ADR-0017: The lossless line model

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Decision.** The syntax layer (`packages/core/src/syntax/`) keeps each line's exact
text and line ending. Tokens hold only spans into that text.

- `write(parse(x)) === x` for **any** input. It is property-tested on arbitrary
  unicode and on every fixture.
- Edits splice text into spans (`editLine`), so every untouched byte survives.
- Spans are UTF-16 code-unit offsets (what JavaScript strings and CodeMirror use).
- Lines are numbered from **1**. Upstream's golden files use 0-based `lineNo`, and the
  parity ledger (parcel 2f) maps between them.
- LF, CRLF and bare CR are all line breaks, and each line records its own. A leading
  BOM is recorded and stripped. The final line always exists, even when it's empty,
  which matches editors.
- The syntax layer is **letter-agnostic**. `A`, `D` and `E` are simply words, and
  whether they mean anything is for the dialect and the interpreter. A bad character
  or an unterminated comment is reported and skipped, and the rest of the line is
  still read. Upstream dropped the whole line (R7).
- Whitespace outside comments is insignificant, including inside a number, per
  RS274/NGC. Upstream did the same. `X1 0` reads as `X10`, with an info diagnostic
  because it's unusual.
- `X1e3` reads as `X1` then an `E3` word, as in RS274, with a warning that
  G-code has no exponent notation (R6).
- Parsing never throws. `editLine` throws only on programming errors (overlapping
  edits, or an inserted line break).

## ADR-0018: Expression rules are per-dialect data; LinuxCNC is the verified default

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Context.** Controllers disagree about how expressions evaluate, and upstream matched
none of them on several points (ANALYSIS §3, N13–N15).

**Decision.** `packages/core/src/expr/` parses and evaluates expressions under an
`ExpressionRules` object, so each dialect profile (parcel 2e) picks its rules instead of
the core hard-coding them. The rules cover:

- precedence levels;
- equality tolerance;
- angle unit;
- MOD sign;
- ROUND halves;
- undefined named parameters;
- the maximum parameter number;
- the maximum nesting depth.

`LINUXCNC_RULES` is the default. **Each of its values was checked against LinuxCNC's
interpreter source, not recalled:**

| Rule                      | Value                                                         | Source                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precedence                | `**` · `* / MOD` · `+ -` · `EQ NE GT GE LT LE` · `AND OR XOR` | LinuxCNC G-code overview, "Operators Precedence"               |
| Equality tolerance        | 1e-6, applied to **EQ, NE, GE and LE only**                   | `TOLERANCE_EQUAL` (`interp_internal.hh:89`); `execute_binary2` |
| GT and LT                 | **plain** `l > r` and `l < r`, with no tolerance              | `interp_execute.cc:156`, `:175`                                |
| Angle unit                | degrees                                                       | `sin(x·π/180)`, `asin(x)·180/π`                                |
| MOD                       | always positive                                               | `interp_execute.cc`: "always calculates a positive answer"     |
| ROUND                     | half away from zero                                           | `(int)(x ± 0.5)`                                               |
| Undefined named parameter | error                                                         | `interp_namedparams.cc:192`                                    |
| Numbered parameters       | 1–5601                                                        | `RS274NGC_MAX_PARAMETERS = 5602` is an array size              |
| Unary +/−                 | before any value                                              | `read_real_value`, `interp_read.cc`                            |
| NaN / ±∞ result           | error                                                         | `read_real_value`                                              |

A consequence worth knowing: for two values within the tolerance of each other but not
equal (say l = r + 5e-7), `EQ`, `GE`, `LE` **and** `GT` are all 1. That looks
inconsistent, but it's what LinuxCNC does. A tidier rule would not be faithful to the
controller, so a test pins the corner (reviewer, toolkit #9).

Evaluation never throws. Division by zero, domain errors, undefined or non-integer
parameters and non-finite results are diagnostics pointing at the responsible
sub-expression. Nesting beyond `maxDepth` (64) is a diagnostic rather than a stack
overflow, which fixes R1: its own example `[SIN[0]+10]` now simply evaluates to 10.

## ADR-0019: The interpreter's contract

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Decision.** `packages/core/src/interp/` turns a parsed program into an ordered list of
`Step`s: linear moves, arcs, dwells, tool changes, spindle, coolant, pauses and the
program end.

- **Order of execution** within a line follows RS274/NGC as LinuxCNC documents it
  ("Order of Execution"), not the order the words are written. That includes **F
  before G20/G21**: `G20 G1 X1 F10` from G21 feeds at 10 mm/min, as in LinuxCNC
  (`execute_block` runs `convert_feed_rate` before `convert_length_units`). Controllers
  disagree on this line, so it's **dialect data** (`InterpreterRules.feedUnits`:
  `at-feed-step`, the LinuxCNC default, or `end-of-line`), and a line that changes units
  alongside an F word gets a **warning** either way. A redundant G21 in a CAM header
  doesn't warn. A feed set on an earlier line stays physically the same across a unit
  change, as in LinuxCNC. _Amended 2026-09-26 (reviewer, toolkit #10): the first draft
  used end-of-line units as the default, which is the opposite of LinuxCNC. Masso's
  behaviour is not yet known; see ADR-0015._
- **Positions are machine coordinates in millimetres.** Every move also carries the
  total work offset in force (coordinate system + G92/G52), so work coordinates are
  `position − offset`. G53, G10, G92 and coordinate-system changes then compose
  exactly, and a viewer can still draw in work coordinates.
- **Offsets live in LinuxCNC's parameter layout**, verified against its "Numbered
  Parameters" documentation. Programs that read or write them (`#5221` and so on) see
  consistent values:
  - G28 home #5161; G30 home #5181;
  - G92/G52 flag #5210 and offsets #5211;
  - active coordinate system #5220;
  - coordinate system _n_ at #5221 + 20(n−1).

  Values are stored in millimetres.

- **A line that can't be executed is reported, and its motion is skipped**, so the tool
  stays where it was (plan §4.2 item 4). That covers:
  - an unknown or not-yet-interpreted code;
  - two codes from one modal group;
  - a repeated word (N3);
  - a letter the dialect doesn't have (E: R6);
  - a syntax or evaluation error;
  - a feed move with no feed rate (upstream silently used 200 mm/min, N10);
  - axis words claimed by both a group-0 code and an explicit motion code.

  Upstream reported such lines and then moved anyway (N5, N6).

- **Words with no effect** on their line (`G1 X1 R5`) are a _warning_, and the line
  still runs. LinuxCNC treats this as an error. We're deliberately lenient, because the
  line's meaning is unambiguous.
- **G28/G30** rapid to the optional intermediate point, then to the stored position,
  for the named axes or for all of them. A program can't know the machine's real stored
  positions, so when it never set them (G28.1/G30.1) the machine origin is used, with
  an info diagnostic saying so.
- **Arcs are described, not resolved.** Each arc step carries its plane, direction, an
  I/J/K centre (absolute, machine coordinates) or a signed R, and P turns. Resolving
  the R-format centre and rejecting impossible arcs is the geometry layer's job
  (parcel 2d: R2). A centre-format full circle with no axis words is legal and runs,
  fixing R3.
- **Not simulated, and said so:**
  - cutter compensation (a warning; ADR-0016);
  - tool length offsets (info; no tool table);
  - coordinate-system rotation (a warning);
  - machine I/O M-codes (a warning).
- **Program end:** M2, M30 or a second `%` ends the program. Later lines aren't run, and
  one info diagnostic says how many were skipped (R8). The block-delete switch
  defaults to **on**, as on most controllers.
- **Diagnostics:** the interpreter reports its own findings (including expression
  errors). Syntax findings stay on the `Program`.
- **Recognised but deferred**, with an error that names the parcel:
  - canned cycles G73 and G81–G89 (2c-2), so a canned cycle is no longer drawn as a
    rapid plunge (R4);
  - O-words and M98/M99 (2c-3).

  Controller-specific tables are for the dialect profiles (2e).

**Performance.** aztec_calendar (224k lines) parses and interprets in about 1.68 s,
the minimum of 10 runs on the reference machine via `node tools/bench-core.mjs`,
against ADR-0014's 2 s target. The geometry layer (2d) has to fit in the remaining
headroom, so it will build its path model without per-segment objects.

## ADR-0020: Canned cycles follow LinuxCNC's source, with the dialect differences as data

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Reference version: LinuxCNC 2.9.x** (stable, v2.9.10), per the reviewer on toolkit #11.
All of this ADR holds on the 2.9 branch and on master, except the peck distances below.

**Decision.** G73, G81, G82 and G83 (XY plane) are interpreted as LinuxCNC's
interpreter does them, from `interp_cycles.cc` (`convert_cycle_xy`, `CYCLE_MACRO`,
`convert_cycle_g73/g81/g82/g83`) rather than its prose docs. The docs say G73 ends at R;
the source retracts to the clearance plane.

- **Preliminary motion:** starting below R, Z rises to R once. Each repeat traverses XY
  (at the current height on the first repeat if above R, otherwise at the clearance
  plane), then rapids down to R.
- **Clearance plane:** R under G99. Under G98, the level when the run of cycles began
  (LinuxCNC `cycle_il`), raised to R if it was below. That level resets whenever an
  ordinary motion runs.
- **G90:** R and Z are work Z levels. **G91:** R is relative to that initial level, and
  Z is relative to R; X/Y step from the current position.
- **G81:** feed to Z, then rapid to clear. **G82:** the same, with a dwell. **G83:** feed
  Q, rapid out to R, then rapid down to `clearance` above the last depth, and repeat.
  **G73:** feed Q, then back off by `retract`, and repeat. Depths are counted from R.
- **Sticky values:** Z, R, Q and P carry over while the same cycle stays active. The
  first line of a cycle must have them.
- **Errors** (the line doesn't run): no R, Z, Q or P on a cycle's first line; R below Z;
  Q ≤ 0; zero feed; inverse-time feed; cutter compensation on; a plane other than XY;
  rotary axis words; a repeat count that isn't a positive integer.
- **G84–G89** are recognised and reported as not implemented. LinuxCNC has them; Masso
  doesn't.

LinuxCNC's two worked G81 examples (absolute, and incremental with L3) are tests,
checked move for move against its documentation.

**Controller differences are `InterpreterRules`** (the dialect profiles in 2e pick them):

| Rule                        | LinuxCNC (default)          | Masso G3 (docs and the 2026-09-26 machine test) |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `dwellUnits` (G4 and G82 P) | seconds                     | **milliseconds**                                |
| `cycleRepeat`               | `L`, stepping X/Y under G91 | **`K`, at the same position**                   |
| `g73Retract`                | 0.254 mm (0.010 in)         | **1.0 mm**                                      |
| `g83Clearance`              | 0.254 mm                    | not documented; the default applies             |

The machine test confirmed Masso's G83 retracts to R between pecks and ends at the
initial Z under G98, as modelled.

**LinuxCNC 2.10 differs on the peck distances.** In 2.9, `G83_RAPID_DELTA` (0.010 in,
0.254 mm under G21) is used for both G73 and G83. On master (2.10; commits c9759fc1b1
and 6dd181d7be):

- the defaults become 1 mm on a metric machine and 0.050 in on an inch one
  (`rs274ngc_pre.cc`);
- they can be set by INI `G73_PECK_CLEARANCE` / `G83_PECK_CLEARANCE`;
- they can be set per block by a **D word**.

A 2.10 profile must set `g73Retract`/`g83Clearance` itself rather than inherit 0.254.
It also needs D read as the peck distance on G73/G83; today D there is an unused word.

## ADR-0021: Subprograms and program flow

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Reference version: LinuxCNC 2.9.x.** The 2.9 branch was checked against master.

- They agree on everything this ADR relies on: control-flow labels scoped per sub
  (`sub#label` in `read_o`), #1–#30 handling, and named-parameter scoping.
- The call limit is the same 9. 2.9 increments `call_level` and then refuses at 10;
  master checks `call_level + 1 >= 10` before incrementing.
- Master adds checks this doesn't depend on: stricter nested-definition errors inside a
  called file, and no forward-seek in a called file.

**Decision.** LinuxCNC's O-word flow and Masso's M98/M99 subprogram files are both
interpreted. They follow LinuxCNC's `interp_o_word.cc` and `interp_read.cc` where the
source and the docs (`o-code.adoc`) differ. Which one a controller has is dialect data.

**O-words (LinuxCNC).** `sub`/`endsub`/`return`/`call`, `if`/`elseif`/`else`/`endif`,
`while`/`endwhile`, `do`/`while`, `repeat`/`endrepeat`, `break`/`continue`.

- **Structure is matched once, up front** (`buildFlowIndex`), not by seeking through the
  file at run time as LinuxCNC does. The index is built the first time the interpreter
  meets an O-word, so a program without O-words pays nothing.
- **Scope:** subroutine labels are global across all loaded files. Control-flow labels
  are local to the subroutine body, or the main program, they're in. Labels are
  normalised: `o0100` is `o100`, and `<My Sub>` is `<mysub>`.
- **Calls:** up to 30 arguments go into #1–#30, and **the unpassed ones are zeroed**.
  2.9's `read_o` says "zero the remaining params", and `execute_call` copies all 30, so
  `o<sub> if [#3 EQ 0]` reliably detects a missing argument. The caller's #1–#30 are
  restored on return. Parameters above #30 are global. _Corrected in review: the first
  cut kept the caller's values (reviewer, toolkit #12)._
- **Named parameters** are local to a call unless their name starts with `_`. That was
  already true of the main program.
- **Return values:** `endsub [v]` or `return [v]` sets `#<_value>` to v and
  `#<_value_returned>` to 1. With no value, both are set to 0 (2.9 `read_o`). They are
  not cleared at a call. Both are predefined (0 before any call) and read-only.
- **Truth:** a condition is true when non-zero. An `elseif` is evaluated whenever
  it's reached, even after an earlier branch ran: `read_o` skips evaluation only for
  other labels, so `[1/0]` there stops the run. A do loop's closing `while` is still
  evaluated after `break`.
- **A `repeat` count rounds half to even** (`round_to_int` is `nearbyint`), so
  `[2.5]` is 2 passes. 0 or less skips the body.
- **Forward calls:** a sub may be called before its definition in the main program. The
  docs forbid it; the source allows it (`control_back_to` step 3).
- **Definitions are skipped** in normal flow and run only when called. Flow reaching a
  definition already recorded is an error, and the run stops. That covers a definition
  after a forward call to it, or one inside a loop: 2.9's `control_save_offset` gives
  "sub … found in illegal location".
- **Other words on an O-word line are an error,** and the run stops. 2.9's `read_o`
  allows "nothing … except comments": "Unexpected character after O-word".
- **A failed call stops the run,** because 2.9 aborts: a subroutine that can't be
  found, a call nested too deep, more than 30 arguments, or an argument that can't be
  evaluated. Drawing on would show a path the machine won't take. _Corrected in review;
  the first cut skipped the call and carried on._
- **Structure errors stop the run.** Carrying on would run code that should be
  skipped, or skip code that should run. The errors are nested definitions, unmatched
  or reused labels, `else` after `else`, unclosed blocks, and `break`/`continue` outside
  a while or do loop. So does a missing or unevaluable condition, and an M99 ending an
  O-word sub.
- **Where we're stricter than 2.9:** it lets some of these pass, such as `else` after
  `else`, an unclosed `if` whose branch is true, and a `return` with the wrong label. A
  preview that flags them is on the safe side.
- **Not yet interpreted:** `o[expr]` label indirection, which the tokenizer doesn't
  read, and Python O-word subs.

**Subprogram files.** The core never reads files. The caller passes
`resolveProgram({ kind, name })`, which returns the file's text or `undefined`.

- The call is synchronous: an async caller fetches first.
- Each file is asked for once and parsed once.
- LinuxCNC `o<name> call` asks for `o-word:<name>` and runs that file's `o<name> sub`.
- Masso `M98 P<n>` asks for `m98:<n>`: the number with no leading zeros, which is the
  Masso rule for file names.
- A missing file, or a resolver that throws, is reported, and the run stops. That's
  what a failed call does on both controllers; Masso "enters Feed Hold".
- Steps and diagnostics from a file carry `file` (the resolver's name) and that file's
  own line numbers. `file` is absent for the main program, so existing consumers see no
  change.

**M98/M99 (Masso).** `M98 P<n> [L<runs>]` runs file n, L times (default once; `L0`
doesn't run it). #1–#30 are shared with the caller, not saved; named locals start
fresh, as in 2.9. The call runs after the rest of its line. M99 returns. A file that
ends without M99 returns with a warning. `%` is tracked per file, so a `%`-wrapped
subprogram file doesn't end the program.

- In the main program, M99 ends the drawing with a warning. LinuxCNC ends there unless
  configured to loop; Masso is untested.
- Under LinuxCNC rules, `M98 P<n>` means a numbered `O<n>` block in the same file (Fanuc
  style). That's reported as not interpreted yet, and the line is not run.

**Two kinds of limit, reported differently:**

| Limit                      | Whose            | Value                                         | Message                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `subprograms.maxCallDepth` | the controller's | LinuxCNC 9, Masso 5                           | stopped: fails on the machine |
| `limits.maxCallDepth`      | ours (resource)  | 64                                            | stopped: too large to process |
| `limits.maxLoopIterations` | ours             | 1,000,000 (while, do, repeat, M98 L)          | stopped                       |
| `limits.maxBlocks`         | ours             | 20,000,000 (each canned-cycle repeat counts)  | stopped                       |
| `limits.maxSteps`          | ours             | 2,000,000 steps: this is what bounds memory   | stopped                       |
| `limits.maxDiagnostics`    | ours             | 10,000; beyond that they're counted, not kept | a closing note                |
| `limits.maxPecks`          | ours             | 10,000 per G73/G83 hole                       | line refused                  |

- **LinuxCNC's 9:** `INTERP_SUB_ROUTINE_LEVELS` is 10, but it counts the main program.
  `enter_context` refuses when `call_level + 1 >= 10`. A test runs 9 levels and refuses
  a 10th.
- **Masso's 5** is from its manual ("up to 5 levels of sub-program nesting"). It isn't
  tested on the machine yet, so it goes on the next machine test sheet.
- The resource limits are `InterpretOptions.limits`, so a server can tighten them.
- Canned-cycle repeats (`L`/`K`) now count against `maxBlocks` before any motion is
  built, so `G81 … L1000000000` can't exhaust memory.
- **The G73/G83 peck loop could fail to terminate** (reviewer, toolkit #12; the code
  came from #11). With a Q below the float resolution of the depth, `d -= Q` stops
  changing d. The peck count, ceil(depth / Q), is now worked out up front. Over
  `maxPecks` the line is refused, the loop in `cycles.ts` is also bounded by the count,
  and the line's steps are checked against `maxSteps` before any are built.
- `maxSteps` and `maxDiagnostics` close the remaining memory route. A loop body of 19
  lines over a million iterations would otherwise exhaust memory long before
  `maxBlocks` tripped.

**Found on the way: a sign before a parameter, bracket or function.** `X-#1`, `X-[…]`,
`X+SIN[…]` and `X--#1` are values in LinuxCNC (`read_real_value` negates what follows).
The 2a tokenizer rejected them, and subroutine code uses them constantly. The tokenizer
now reads them as an expression whose span includes the sign; the expression parser
already handled a leading sign. The lossless property is unaffected.

**The R8 O-word fixtures** now differ from upstream deliberately.
`r8-o-word-sub.ngc` draws its move to X10 with no diagnostics; upstream gave three
"did not understand line" errors and drew nothing. `r8-program-number.ngc` reads its
`O1000` without complaint. Tests pin both against the legacy goldens.

## ADR-0022: Arcs are resolved and validated as LinuxCNC does; the path model

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26.

**Reference version: LinuxCNC 2.9.x.** The logic of `arc_data_ijk`, `arc_data_r` and
`find_turn`, and the tolerance constants, are the same on the 2.9 branch and on master.
Several function signatures moved to enum classes on master; the substance didn't
change.

**Decision: arcs.** Every G2/G3 is resolved to a centre, a start radius, an end
radius and a signed sweep. The code is `interp/arcs.ts`, transcribed from
`interp_arc.cc` (`arc_data_ijk`, `arc_data_r`) and `interp_find.cc` (`find_turn`). An
arc the controller would refuse is reported, and the line doesn't run: the tool stays
where it was.

- **R format.** The centre is on the chord's perpendicular bisector, and a negative R
  takes the major arc.
  - A radius that can't reach the end point is an error (R2: upstream drew nothing and
    said nothing). There's a 0.00005 in (0.00127 mm) allowance, and a near-semicircle is
    snapped.
  - An end point equal to the start is an error.
  - An arc with no in-plane axis word is an error: a full circle can't be given by R.
- **Centre format.** An arc with no axis words is a full circle (R3: upstream dropped
  it). A centre on the start or end point is an error.
- **Radius mismatch** between start and end, as `arc_data_ijk` judges it:
  - over 100× the tolerance is always an error;
  - over 1× the tolerance is an error only if the mismatch also exceeds 0.1% of the
    radius.
  - The tolerance is 0.0283 mm, or 0.00283 in for inch programs. Units are the
    program's, as in LinuxCNC.
  - An accepted mismatch is a spiral: the radius changes evenly with angle, which is
    how LinuxCNC's planner moves.
- **Sweep: the path the machine cuts** (corrected in review, toolkit #14). The first
  cut used the interpreter's `find_turn`. In 2.9 that only feeds arc length and inverse
  time. The motion planner's `pmCircleInit` (`_posemath.c`) decides the path cut, so
  `motionSweep` transcribes it:
  - the angle between the start radius and the end radius, projected and scaled, taken
    the long way round when (rTan × rEnd)·normal < `CART_FUZZ` (1e-8);
  - **a FULL circle when the start and end, projected onto the plane, are within
    1e-8**. That's the case after incremental moves that return to the start with
    rounding noise, where `find_turn` gave a sweep of zero and drew nothing;
  - `CIRCLE_FUZZ`/2 for an angle of exactly zero;
  - 2π for each extra turn.
- **One deliberate numerical difference:** the angle is computed as
  atan2(|cross|, dot), not acos(dot / r²). They're the same angle, but acos rounds to 0
  for a 10 mm chord at radius 1e14, which would make it a 50 km arc. `find_turn` is kept
  and exported; away from the fuzz a test holds the two equal.
- Positive sweep is counter-clockwise from the plane's first axis to its second (XY, ZX,
  YZ). P within 0.001 of a whole number is accepted and rounded (2.9 `interp_check`).
- **Word checks from 2.9's `convert_arc`,** each refusing the line:
  - a centre word for another plane (K in G17);
  - a missing centre word under G90.1 (under G91.1 it's 0);
  - a G2/G3 with no I/J/K/R, even with no axis words.
- **Fail-closed, and finite.** Every tolerance check asks "is it within?", so a NaN
  refuses the line. Non-finite values (e.g. a G20 overflow of x25.4) are refused, for
  arcs (`SEMANTIC_ARC_NOT_FINITE`) and straight moves (`SEMANTIC_NOT_FINITE`).
- **R0,** or any R below the radius tolerance, is refused. 2.9 takes asin(0/0) and
  moves on a NaN arc; that would break the no-silent-NaN rule.

**The step shape changed** (pre-1.0; see the changeset). An arc step now always has
`centre`, and adds `radius`, `endRadius` and `sweep`. The old `centre: null` and signed
R radius are gone. Consumers get resolved geometry and never redo the maths.

**The tolerance is dialect data** (`InterpreterRules.arcTolerance`), because
controllers differ a lot. LinuxCNC refuses a 0.5 mm mismatch on a 10 mm radius, but
Masso accepted exactly that in the 2026-09-26 machine test. Masso's real limit is
unknown and is on the machine-test backlog. Parcel 2e sets it.

**Decision: the path model** (`path/`). The plan's typed arrays turned out to be a
derived view, not a replacement for steps.

- **Why steps stay.** The budget problem was a fast-path bug (the G letter was missing),
  not per-step allocation. With it fixed, parse + interpret of aztec takes about 0.8 s
  locally, and the CI ratio is about 0.65× against the 1.45× limit.
- **`tessellate(steps, { chordTolerance })`** gives the whole path as ONE polyline:
  - Float64 x/y/z per vertex, plus each vertex's step index and kind (rapid, feed or
    arc), ready for a GPU buffer.
  - It's continuous by construction, because a line that can't run doesn't move the
    tool.
  - Chords stay within the tolerance of the true arc (default 1 µm, as upstream),
    including helices and spirals.
  - **Budgets, counted before anything is allocated** (corrected in review: one legal
    line, `G2 I-5 P126000`, allocated 574 MB):
    - `maxChordsPerArc` (100,000) coarsens any single arc over it;
    - `maxVertices` (2,000,000, about 58 MB) coarsens all arcs together to fit;
    - only a program with more MOVES than the budget is truncated.
    - The result reports `coarsened` and `truncated`.
  - **The chord count uses 4 asin(√(tol / 2r)).** It stays accurate at huge radii, where
    the earlier 2 acos(1 − tol/r) rounded to zero, the count became infinite, and
    everything after the arc was dropped.
  - Arrays are sized in one counting pass, then filled. That's 11 ms on aztec (226k
    vertices).
- **`pathBounds(steps)`** gives the exact box for all moves, and separately for feed
  moves and for rapids.
  - It comes from the geometry, not the chords: each arc's end points, plus the first
    and last point where it faces each cardinal direction. Only those two matter,
    because the radius changes evenly.
  - For a spiral the true extreme is a hair off the cardinal angle; the error is under
    1 µm at any tolerance a controller accepts.
  - Also 11 ms on aztec.
- **Positions are machine coordinates.** Showing work coordinates (subtracting each
  step's `offset`) is the viewer's call, in Phase 3.

**Evidence:**

- **Property tests:** every chord of random arcs is within tolerance, across all planes,
  both directions, 1–3 turns, helices, and tolerances of 1 µm to 0.1 mm. The exact box
  contains the tessellation and is within the tolerance of its box.
- **Mutation checks:** halving the chord count, or dropping the relative mismatch test,
  turns a test red.
- **Parity:** the exact bounding box matches upstream's recorded box on all four upstream
  files, to the golden's 4 decimal places. Upstream was right there, so we agree.

## ADR-0023: Dialect profiles, and what the Masso G3 profile is made of

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26. Parcel 2e-1; 2e-2 completes the Masso profile.

**Decision.** A `Dialect` gathers everything that differs between controllers:
expression rules plus `InterpreterRules`. You pass `interpret(program, { dialect })`,
and `rules` / `interpreterRules` still override its parts.

- **Three profiles:**
  - `MASSO_G3`: v5.13, Woodpatch's router, the primary one.
  - `LINUXCNC`: 2.9, the verified reference.
  - `GENERIC`: LinuxCNC semantics, accepting every code known here. It's for a program
    whose controller is unknown.
- **The default stays LinuxCNC,** so the core's behaviour doesn't depend on which
  machine Woodpatch owns. Apps choose Masso explicitly.

**New `InterpreterRules`** (each is data, and each has a source):

| Rule           | LinuxCNC 2.9            | Masso G3 v5.13                                                       | Evidence                   |

| `parameters`   | yes                     | **no**: `#`, `[ ]` and functions make the line not run               | T10–T14                    |

These come from parcels 2c-2 and 2c-3 (ADR-0020, ADR-0021):

| Rule          | LinuxCNC 2.9 | Masso G3 v5.13          |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `dwellUnits`  | seconds      | **milliseconds**        |
| `cycleRepeat` | L            | **K**, same place       |
| `g73Retract`  | 0.254 mm     | **1 mm**                |
| `subprograms` | O-words      | **M98 files**, 5 levels |

**Why a code outside the list refuses the whole line.** Masso's docs say "the entire
line is ignored", and T8 showed it: `G64 G0 X20` didn't move. That matters for CAM
posts written for other controllers. `G0 G43 Z15 H1` doesn't move on a Masso, and the
Masso profile shows exactly that. A preview that quietly ran the Z move would be wrong
in the dangerous direction.

**MSG lines are syntax, not G-code.** `MSG text` is recognised by the tokenizer at the
start of a line, or after its N word, for every dialect. Read as words, it would be
letter soup: `M`, `S`, `G` and the text as garbage. The Masso profile turns it into a
`message` step. Other profiles warn that it's Masso syntax. LinuxCNC's own
`(MSG, text)` comments become `message` steps too.

**The evidence is replayed as a test.** The machine-test program is stored byte for
byte in `fixtures/machine/`. Under `MASSO_G3`, every stop from T1 to T17 lands where the
DRO read on the machine, to within 0.01 mm (the DRO steps in about 0.005 mm). T18
retracts to R and ends at the initial Z. Mutating the G80 rule or the `/` rule turns
the replay red.

**Held for 2e-2,** because Masso's meanings differ from LinuxCNC's:

- G10 L2.1 and L20: on Masso, L20 sets the extended offsets G54.1 P1–P100.
- G28: machine home, Z first, via an intermediate point in work coordinates.
- G30: the parking table, Z first.
- G54.1 itself, M6.1, and M66 waits.
- The M6 ordering warnings: T before M6, and M5 before M6.
- The spindle-speed advice (operator, 2026-09-26).
- A warning band for the arc limit that's not yet measured.

Until then those codes are reported as not interpreted yet, and the line doesn't run:
a stated gap rather than a guess.

## ADR-0024: The Masso profile's positions, waits and advice

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26. Parcel 2e-2 completes the Masso profile (ADR-0023).

**Decision.** Five more `InterpreterRules`, each set for Masso from its docs (v5.13),
and one tolerance option.

| Rule                  | LinuxCNC 2.9                                | Masso G3 v5.13                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g10`                 | L2 sets; L20 = current position reads value | L2 sets; **L2.1 = active offset + value**; **L20/L20.1 = the same for G54.1 P1–P100**                |
| `homing`              | G28/G30 to #5161/#5181, all axes together   | **G28 to machine home, G30 to the parking position; Z first, then the rest**                         |
| `m66`                 | machine I/O, ignored                        | **a `wait` step**: P input, Q timeout (ms), S = lines skipped if met                                 |
| `toolChangeChecks`    | off                                         | **warn** if T follows M06 on the line, or the spindle is running at M06                              |
| `spindleSettleAdvice` | off                                         | **info**: a speed change while running, then a feed move with no dwell between                       |
| `arcTolerance.beyond` | `error`                                     | **`warn`**: from the tested 0.5 mm up to 100× it (50 mm), drawn with a warning; beyond that, refused |

**G54.1 P1–P100** (Masso's extended offsets, modal group 12) are coordinate systems
101–200, stored with the others. `ModalState.coordinateSystem` reports them that way.

**Machine positions are the caller's data.** `InterpretOptions.machine.home` and
`.park` hold machine coordinates.

- **Home defaults to the machine origin.** This router's home is all zeros (its setup
  screen, 2026-09-26).
- **An unknown parking position** is reported, and the G30 move isn't drawn. Guessing a
  position would draw a path the machine won't take. These values belong to the Phase 5
  machine profile, which will pass them in.

**G28 with axis words.** It rapids to the named point first: work coordinates under
G90, incremental under G91 (the docs' `G91 G28 Z8`). Then only the named axes go home,
Z first. Moves that don't change anything aren't drawn.

**M66's S is not a spindle speed on Masso.** It's the number of lines to skip. The
preview draws those lines, as if the input condition wasn't met, and warns.

**Two readings of ambiguous docs** are on the machine-test backlog:

- G10 L2.1 reads as "active offset + value".
- The G28 intermediate move is one combined rapid.

## ADR-0025: The parity ledger, and Phase 2's acceptance evidence

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26. Parcel 2f.

**Decision.** `tools/parity.mjs` compares the core's path with upstream's on every
fixture, line by line. Every difference must be explained by a rule in
`tools/data/parity-ledger.json`, which names the upstream defect (ANALYSIS R/N) or the
decision behind it. CI runs `--check`, which fails in three cases:

- a difference no rule explains;
- a rule that no longer explains anything;
- `docs/PARITY.md` (generated) out of date.

**How it compares:**

- **Upstream's full path is regenerated** with the golden harness, not read from the
  golden. Large goldens store only a sample. Each regeneration is checked against the
  golden's SHA-256, so the comparison covers all 307,313 upstream segments.
- **The core** runs the LinuxCNC 2.9 dialect.
- **Per line,** each move is compared on:
  - its kind (rapid, feed or arc);
  - its end point, to 0.1 µm;
  - its feed, including the feed mode;
  - for arcs, the centre and the signed sweep, to 1 µrad.
- **Each difference is tagged** from what the two sides said on that line:
  `upstream-threw`, `zero-length`, `core:<diagnostic codes>`, `upstream-error` or
  `other`.
- **Rules match on a file glob and a tag.** They're tried in order, and the first match
  wins.

**Result:**

- **97 of 307,388 lines with motion differ, and all 97 are explained.**
- **The four upstream sample programs** differ ONLY where upstream dropped a
  zero-length move (R9): 59 lines across 307k.
- **Every other difference is in a fixture written to show a defect** (R1–R9, N3, N4,
  N6, N10, N12), and it's exactly the defect that fixture was written for.
- **Every arc upstream drew correctly matches in centre and direction,** as well as end
  point. That includes aztec's 235 arcs.
- **Mutation check:** reversing the core's arc direction leaves 249 differences
  unexplained, and the check fails.

**One deviation from the ANALYSIS fix table (R9: "keep every move; flag degenerate
ones").** Moves are kept, but a zero-length move is not flagged. A move to where the
tool already is, such as `G0 X0 Y0` at the start, is routine in CAM output: 54 of them
in one sample file. A diagnostic on each would bury real ones. The estimator gives
them no length.

**Phase 2 acceptance (plan §5), with the evidence for each:**

| Criterion                                                                          | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## ADR-0026: The 3D viewer: framework-free, worker-backed, three.js as a peer

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26. Parcel 3a.

**Decision.** `@woodpatch/gcode-viewer` draws a program in 3D with three.js, as a
framework-free class. Svelte wrapping comes later (3e).

- **three.js is a peer dependency** (`>=0.186.0 <0.187.0`). The host provides it, and
  the build keeps every dependency and peer EXTERNAL, so a page never ships two copies
  (plan §4.1). `scripts/build-package.mjs` now takes `woodpatch.entries` and externalises
  `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`.
- **Version and cooldown:** 0.186.0 was chosen under the 7-day release cooldown
  (0.186.1 was a day old). three.js makes breaking changes between 0.x minors, so the peer
  range is a single minor, widened as each new one is tested.
- **The pipeline is one function, `loadProgram(text, { dialect })`:** parse → interpret →
  tessellate → bounds. It returns only typed arrays and cloneable data. Each vertex is
  tied to its source line; vertices from a subprogram FILE get line 0, since they belong
  to another file's lines.
- **Worker:** `@woodpatch/gcode-viewer/worker` runs `loadProgram` and transfers the arrays
  back, without copying. `ProgramLoader` allows one load at a time. A newer load, an
  abort, or the **time budget** (`timeoutMs`, default 30 s, 0 = off) TERMINATES the busy
  worker. That's the only way to stop a parse mid-way (plan §4.8, "time budget with
  cancellation").
  - Each load owns its abort listener and timer. They're removed when it settles, and
    they only cancel their own load. _Corrected in review (toolkit #20): the listener
    outlived its load, cancelling a newer one and piling up on a shared signal._
  - `/worker` is declared in `sideEffects`, so a bundler can't drop a bare
    `import '…/worker'`.
- **Real line widths:** `LineSegments2` and `LineMaterial` in screen pixels. That fixes R12,
  where upstream's `linewidth: 1.5` was ignored and everything drew at 1 px.
- **Precision:** positions go to the GPU as Float32 RELATIVE TO THE PATH'S CENTRE. Every
  path includes the move from home, so a 4 m bed resolves about 0.12 µm, well below what
  can be seen. A test holds every vertex within 0.25 µm.
- **Upstream's colour language is kept, and is configurable (`palette`):** white cuts,
  red rapids, a yellow highlight, an orange grid.
- **Grid and view:** the grid sits on the machine's Z0 plane, sized in 1/2/5 × 10ⁿ mm
  cells. Z is up; the views are iso, top, front and right, fitted to the path.
- **Line ↔ path:** `buildLineIndex` maps each line to its RUNS of segments (a subroutine
  called twice owns two runs) and each segment back to its line. `highlightLine(n)` draws
  them on top. A click that isn't a drag picks the nearest segment within `pickRadius` px
  and reports its line.
- **Rendering on demand:** a frame is drawn after a change, not on a loop, so an idle
  view uses no GPU.
- **Lifecycle:** `dispose()` also calls `forceContextLoss()`, because browsers cap live
  WebGL contexts at about 16, and it frees the grid's material. Calls after dispose are
  ignored, and a cancelled gesture clears the pick state.
- **Implausible coordinates:** a path spanning more than 100 m gets a
  `VIEW_SPAN_IMPLAUSIBLE` warning. Scene coordinates are clamped to ±1e9 mm, so values
  finite in Float64 but beyond Float32 never reach the GPU as Infinity.
- **Diagnostics quote G-code:** the README tells hosts to render them as text, never
  HTML.

**The operator's Phase 3 decisions (#1171), as they apply here:**

- WebGL2 only; WebGPU is deferred.
- The 60 fps target is measured on a real machine. CI gates proxies instead.
- The first proxies, on aztec (226k vertices):
  - GPU buffers: about 12 ms;
  - the line index: about 44 ms;
  - one draw call for the whole path (plus the highlight and the grid).
- Loading takes about 1.2 s, in the worker.

**Testing.** The pure parts run in Node:

- `loadProgram`: all five reference files, dialects, diagnostics;
- the geometry: centring, colours, Float32 precision;
- the line index: repeated runs;
- the worker protocol;
- `ProgramLoader`: a superseding load terminates the worker; stale replies, aborts, and a
  worker failure then recovery.

The WebGL class itself is exercised in a real browser by the playground's Playwright
tests (parcels 3c and 3f), on the CI runner's preinstalled Chrome.

## ADR-0027: The editor: CodeMirror 6, highlighted by the core's own tokenizer

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-26. Parcel 3b.

**Decision.** `@woodpatch/gcode-editor` is a set of CodeMirror 6 extensions (`gcode()`),
not a finished editor. The host brings CodeMirror (a peer dependency) and its own
setup (keys, history, search).

- **Highlighting uses the core's `tokenizeLine`,** not a separate grammar, so the editor
  colours exactly what the interpreter reads. A word's colour says its role: motion (G),
  machine (M), positions, arc centres, feed/speed, tool, line numbers, parameters.
  Comments recede, and expressions are underlined as computed. O-words, assignments,
  Masso `MSG` lines, `/`, `%` and checksums each have their own style.
- **Only the visible lines are decorated** (a view plugin over `visibleRanges`), so a
  224k-line file costs what the screen shows.
- **Diagnostics:** `showDiagnostics(view, diagnostics)` maps the core's line and span to
  document offsets for the lint gutter:
  - the span when there is one, the whole line otherwise;
  - line 0 (whole-program notes) goes on line 1;
  - offsets are shifted past a byte-order mark on line 1, which the core's line text
    doesn't include;
  - spans are clamped to the line.
    Diagnostics from a subprogram FILE belong to another file's lines. They're counted
    (returned), not shown.
- **Folding:** O-word blocks (`sub`, `if`, `while`, `do` → `while`, `repeat`) fold to the
  line before their closer, so the closer stays visible.
  - Labels are normalised as the core does (`o0100` = `o100`, `<My Sub>` = `<mysub>`).
  - Same-label blocks nest.
  - The search looks at most 20,000 lines ahead, and only tokenizes lines that could hold
    an O-word, so a fold never costs a scan of a huge file.
  - It deliberately doesn't use the interpreter's flow index: folding runs per visible
    line, and re-indexing the whole document there would be too slow.
- **Line ↔ path** (upstream's UX, kept per plan §2.3):
  - `onCursorLine` reports the cursor's line when it changes.
  - `showPathLine(view, n)` marks the viewer's picked line and scrolls to it WITHOUT
    moving the cursor, so a viewer click can't bounce back as a cursor move.
  - The mark follows its line through edits above it.
- **Build:** the same externalising build as the viewer (ADR-0026), so the bundle is
  9.8 KB and imports CodeMirror and the core. The peers were chosen under the 7-day
  cooldown: state 6.7.5, view 6.43.12, language 6.12.4, lint 6.9.7.

**Testing.** 12 tests run on CodeMirror's `EditorState` in Node:

- span classes and never throwing;
- diagnostic offsets (BOM, clamping, line 0, subprogram files), checked against a real
  program;
- folds (every block kind, labels, nesting, no closer, empty body);
- the path-line field (set, move, clear, following edits);
- the cursor line.

Mutation-checked on the BOM shift and the do→while pairing. View-level behaviour
(scrolling, the gutter, hover) gets real-browser tests with the playground (3c/3f).
